### Problem

While blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular in the finance sector and among software engineers, there remains a significant divide between everyday users and those more experienced with cryptocurrencies. The payment splitting app aims to bridge this gap by offering a simple, intuitive tool that can be adopted by a mainstream audience.

One key challenge faced by users in big groups or those in a rush is the time and effort required to manually calculate and track individual expenses. This app solves that problem by offering fast and efficient payment splitting without needing detailed input from each participant. Users can quickly divide costs, even for large groups, without the hassle of collecting too much information.

The appâ€™s streamlined process allows users to split expenses and execute payments on the go, making it perfect for situations where time is of the essence, like dining with friends, travelling, or group activities. By leveraging blockchain technology and automation, the app ensures smooth, secure transactions while minimizing the complexity for everyday users.
